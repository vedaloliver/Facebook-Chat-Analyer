# My first project : A Simple Facebook Scraper

This was the first project I have worked on, so it is a little bit rudimentary in complexity and algorithmic cleanliness.

Inspiration for this project came from the understanding that it was possible to gather all of my past facebook chat data. With vastly large amounts of data presented to the individual, it was only viable to construct a script to gather and understand certain trends in my conversational data.

This was created to both test and display a number of competencies i have been learning, such as:

- Comfort and understanding of project development
- General algorithmic complexity
- use of JSON parsing/scraping to gather necessary data

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Various functions include:

1.  Frequency of recipients in a given chat:
- This allows the user to gather data from any chat, either a 2 person chat, or a large, multi person conversation.
- Gives both the number of messages and the message proportion, showing who has spoken the most or the least.

2. Frequency of mentioned words or phrases
This function allows the user to either:
- See a chat participant's most frequent words or phrases mentioned. The user will be prompted to give a number, which represents how many words will be in the sequence - for example, 3 will produce the most 3 word phrases in the text, such as 'I love you'.
- Gives the opportunity for the user to input a phrase, to see how many times the word or phase has been mentioned in the chat.

3. Time frequencies
This gives the user to find out the most frequent time for each message in the chat, giving the opportunity to produce:
- A: Frequency by Hour
- B: Frequency by Month
- C: Frequency by Year

How to :

Your information is freely available to request from facebook, and may be located at this link :
- https://www.facebook.com/dyi/?referrer=ayi

Once you have directed yourself to the link, select only the 'Messages' to be requested. For compatibility with the project, the format of the file must be JSON. Once requested, Facebook will notify you within 1-3 days that the files are available to you.

Once this is complete, locate the folder and add it to the directory of this project. input will request for a file name to provide.

While i have completed the majority of the intended code in this project, there are many aspects i would like to add to this project for completeness; these are:

- Correct and useful implementation of data visualization with matplotlib
- Addition of more statistical analysis, with much greater complexity
- Development of front end knowledge to input the code into and provide the user with a smoother experience
- Rewriting the algorithms to provide a faster return on results
